# QG8-Python
Python librarys for implementing, writing and reading QG8 graphs.

QG8 is a lightweight format for storing and exchanging numerical tensor data and data flow graphs in a binary format. It was created as way to store quantum models and data in a single file, including quantum gate and quantum circuit specifications, control pulse definitions, time independent and time-dependent model Hamiltonians, device characteristics, calibration data and noise models, user defined control flow instructions and simulation or measurement results. This facilitates numerical simulation and optimization of quantum problems as well as interfacing with quantum computers. For more information on the QG8 specification and programmer's reference see: https://github.com/aQCess/QG8

**This repository includes the Python QG8 package and a getting started tutorial in Jupyter notebook format**
